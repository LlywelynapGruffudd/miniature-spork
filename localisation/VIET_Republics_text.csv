EVTDESC_REP_413;Some time ago, a merchant galley working for the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] family brought back several visiting dignitaries from a distant land. It seems one of them, a woman, has become the target of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s infatuation. After courting her for weeks, she has finally agreed to marry him, take up his faith, and settle in [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName].;Il y a quelques temps, une galère de marchands travaillant pour la famille [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] a ramené d’un pays lointain plusieurs dignitaires en visite. Il semble que l’une de ces dignitaires ait ému le cœur de [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Après des semaines passées à la courtiser, elle a finalement accepté de l’épouser, d’adopter sa foi et de s’installer à [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName].;Vor geraumer Zeit brachte ein Handelsschiff, das für die [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Familie arbeitet, mehrere Würdenträger aus einem fernen Land zu Besuch. Es scheint, dass einer von ihnen, eine Frau, das Ziel von [From.GetTitledFirstName]s Vernarrtheit geworden ist. Nachdem er sie für Wochen umworben hat, hat sie endlich zugestimmt, ihn zu heiraten, seinen Glauben anzunehmen und nach [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName] zu ziehen.;;Hace algún tiempo, una galera mercante que faenaba para la familia [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] trajo de vuelta a varios dignatarios de lejanas tierras. Al parecer, uno de ellos, una mujer, se ha convertido en el objeto de deseo de [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Tras cortejarla durante semanas, finalmente ella ha aceptado casarse con él, convertirse a su fe y asentarse en [Root.MercRepCapital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.3101.desc;For as long as anyone could remember, [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] had always been friends with this girl. Because they lived close to each other, they always played together when they were children. Now, their childhood friendship has blossomed into true love, and they will soon be wed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3101.a;Aw, isn’t that sweet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3102.desc;You’ve always known [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] as a generous and kind-hearted sort of fellow. He seemed to be very fond of a sweet orphan girl a few years younger than he - the last heir of an obscure patrician heir - treating her like a little sister. Now, news has arrived that they will soon marry.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3102.a;May the two live well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3103.desc;When [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] was younger, you would always see him with this girl that was a little older than he was. Some say she was sort of like an older sister to him. You are not surprised when they announced that they are about to get married.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3103.a;I wish them the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3104.desc;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3104.a;Xxxxxxffff;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3105.desc;You’ve always figured [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] had a thing for tomboys. He is about to marry the daughter of a renowned local veteran. This girl seems to have learned quite a number of things about the martial arts from her father.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3105.a;Wonder if he can handle a woman like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3106.desc;Meeting [family_member.GetTitledFirstName]’s new bride was uncomfortable. She is clever and sharp of tongue, and merciless when she constantly taunts him. People say the couple enjoy each other’s company, but what sort of man can put up with her? Perhaps this is what they call belligerent sexual tension.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3106.a;So Miss, you claim to be made up of ninety seven pounds of spite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3107.desc;The marriage has already been arranged, but you’re not sure whether to feel sorry for [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] because he married an imbecile, or the girl because she doesn’t know she’s an imbecile.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3107.a;But there’s no way she can be that stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3108.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName]’s new bride is an absolute angel, flawless in her virtue and sweetness. It’s a little odd, in a way, even creepy perhaps. Well, at least he found a good wife. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3108.a;Probably. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3110.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] has recently announced his marriage to the daughter of a lesser known patrician family. There seems to be nothing particularly special about this girl or her family, but the marriage seems to serve [family_member.GetTitledFirstName]’s interests well.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3110.a;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3111.desc;To be honest, you’re not sure why [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] is marrying this girl. He hasn’t explained his reasons, so you’ve been left completely in the dark about the matter - even the rest of your family, and your business associates, are uncertain why he wants this girl. But he said he will, so that was the end of that. There’s not much you can do at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3111.a;I do wish he was more open with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3112.desc;The announcement came rather quickly! [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] is wedding the daughter of one of the lesser patricians. That said, you have heard rumors about this girl’s good business sense. In other words, she is very competent in matters of trade and commerce.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3112.a;A good addition to our family, I hope?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3113.desc;You’re not sure whether to believe it or not. [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] claims that the new bride he picked was a noblewoman whose family fled into exile out of political concerns. But is this really the case, or is this girl just a cunning schemer?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3113.a;It’s hard to tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3114.desc;Unthinkable! How could [family_member.GetTitledFirstName] be so reckless? First he says he’ll marry this… this whore (one whose exploits are more than infamous around these parts), then he actually goes and marries her! He’s that infatuated with a common prostitute!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3114.a;This is giving me a headache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3115.desc;True, [family_member.GetTitledFirstName]’s decision isn’t without wisdom - the girl he said he’ll marry certainly is well-connected, from a good family, and so on. But… after meeting her… you come to the conclusion she is one nasty woman and terrible human being.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3115.a;Um… good luck?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3116.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] has been preparing for his marriage for a while now. You’ve just met his bride-to-be, and she is, to put it bluntly, interesting. That is, she is extremely shameless, a lustful exhibitionist who cares not about social mores and spiritual values! She talks about copulation like it was the weather, for instance, and wears revealing clothing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3116.a;Hopefully… she’s still a good person deep down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3118.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] will soon marry the daughter of a well-known religious scholar. Whether this was done out of admiration for this learned man, or simply a ploy for some political and religious power, you do not know.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3118.a;A good choice, nevertheless, I suppose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3120.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to marry the daughter of a local merchant who was originally from India. He hopes the union will provide him some useful business contacts in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3120.a;I wish them the best, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3121.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to marry the daughter of a local merchant who was originally from the Iranian plateau. He hopes the union will provide him some useful business contacts in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3121.a;I wish them the best, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3122.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] met a Chinese woman during one of his business trips, and has decided to marry her. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3122.a;Good for him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3123.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] met a woman from the spice Islands during one of his business trips, and has decided to marry her. They say the women from this region are shrewd negotiators and merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3123.a;Good for him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3124.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] met a woman from Indo-China during one of his business trips, and has decided to marry her. They say the women from this region are shrewd negotiators and merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3124.a;Good for him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3126.desc;[family_member.GetTitledFirstName] recently purchased a slave girl, and has decided to marry her. She originally came from the regions around Sogdia and the Tarim Basin, whose women are renowned for their beauty. Marrying a slave, while not discouraged, isn’t exactly a good business decision…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.3126.a;I won’t deny she’s attractive though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
