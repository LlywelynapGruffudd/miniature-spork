sartapaw;Silk Road Trader;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sartapaw_desc;This character is a well-known and important caravan leader, trader and traveller of the Silk Road. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.1.desc;You have shown ability as a Sartapaw, a local Sogdian leader. Having managed the commercial and diplomatic issues of the community for years, you've gained much experience and insight. The Sogdians may no longer dominate the Silk Road like before, but your ability as a leader shows that the entrepreneurial and adventurous spirit of the Sogdian people endures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.1.a;May the spirits of our forefathers guide us in these difficult times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.2.desc;You have shown ability as a Sartapaw, a local Sogdian leader. Having managed the commercial and diplomatic issues of the community for years, you've gained much experience and insight. The Sogdians are beginning to prosper now that the Silk Road has revived, and your ability as a leader is a sign of the Sogdians' enduring entrepreneurial and adventurous spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.2.a;May the Sogdian people prosper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.name;A New merchant Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.desc;Shrewd and opportunistic merchants coming from the Silk Routes have settled in large numbers in [Root.GetName]. Not just merchants, but their accompanying farmers, warriors, noblemen, and other colonists bring along with them connections to the massive trade network that sustained the Silk Road. If this colony succeeds, it will bring us much profit and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.3.a;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.name;Merchant Colony in Decline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.desc;The Silk Road merchants in [Root.GetName] are beginning to desert their once prosperous colony in droves. It appears that this colony has failed, unable to bring profit to the greater network of traders. Perhaps this spells trouble for the mighty Silk Road!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.4.a;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.6.desc;Great [Root.GetTitledName], hero, vanquisher, liberator, conqueror, mighty among all men - you have revived the Empire of Serindia. Driving out the barbaric warlords and invaders who have dominated the Sogdian homeland, you have proven that we Sogdians are not just cowards only good at commerce - we too, have a martial spirit! Sogdiana prevails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.6.a;And now we can finally start making some real profits again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.name;Triumph of the Merchant Race;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.desc;Once the Silk Road began to decline, the Sogdians, who once dominated it, began to decline as well. Countless waves of invaders ranging from the Turks to the Arab Muslims trampled over the once-prosperous cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and others. However, the great and accomplished [Root.GetFirstName] has made a name for [Root.GetHerselfHimself] by uniting many of the Sogdian principalities and cities under the Kingdom of Sogdiana.\n\nNow that Sogdiana is under centralized, stable leadership, it is likely that the Sogdian peoples might be able to reclaim their former glory not just in commercial matters, but military matters as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.a;It's time for us Sogdians to make some money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.7.b;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.name;The Sogdians Must Endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.desc;Much of the Silk Road's prosperity was due to the industriousness of the Sogdian people, who held great sway over the commercial and religious networks they established across the ancient trade routes.\n\nRecently, however, with the collapse of both the Tang Dynasty and the Uighur Khanate, and the chaos within the Muslim Caliphate, the Sogdians have no one to protect them, as they had relied on the protection and patronage of powerful realms. This will not do, of course. You wish to revive the Silk Road, and you understand well that it is only possible if you support the Sogdian merchants. You thus establish yourself as their protector and guarantor. With stability in Central Asia, it is hoped that the Sogdians will once again prosper, like in the days of old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.8.a;We shall see to it that the Silk Road prospers once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.name;Twilight of the Silk Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.desc;The steppes and mountains of Eurasia are growing silent for the first time in millennia. Just a few mere decades and centuries ago, the realms between China and the Mediterranean bustled with commerce and the exchange of ideas.\n\nNow? A few merchants and pilgrims still walk the once-busy routes that criss-cross Eurasia, but they are an insignificant fraction of the massive numbers that once flourished on the Silk Road.\n\nSogdians... The peoples who once prospered from the Silk Road are now shadow of their former selves. With the increasing chaos in Central Asia, and the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, it seems unlikely that the Silk Road will be able to rise to prominence ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.a;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.100.b;As long as no one takes the riches we Sogdians worked hard for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.name;The Silk Road Lingers On;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.desc;Not too long ago Central Asia was in chaos. Yet, against all odds, the Silk Road still manages to encourage some degree of commerce and cultural interaction presently.\n\nPerhaps its stewards - be they the shrewd Sogdians, the devout Xiongnu, the brave Turks, or other such peoples - still find use in the long routes that stretch from China to the Mediterranean.\n\nAnd perhaps, if these people are diligent enough in their work, the Silk Road shall endure its current state of decay, and once again be the center of trade and culture it once was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.a;We shall see if the Silk Road continues to rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.102.b;There will hopefully be many profits in store for us Sogdians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.name;Dawn of a New Silk Road;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.desc;For centuries, they peddled their wares - silk, above all - across the unforgiving desert and endless steppes. For centuries, they preached visions of paradise and eternal peace, whether Buddhist, Manichean, Zoroastrian, or Abrahamic. For centuries, they prospered and flourished.\n\nNow, the peoples of the Silk Road have reason to celebrate again. Against all odds - the chaos in Central Asia, and the rise of the maritime trade routes of the Indian Ocean - the Silk Road is becoming a hub of commerce and cultural exchange once more now that the turmoil in Central Asia is receding, and China is once more reunited under the Song.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.a;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.103.b;Greed is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.209.desc;There are a number of Turkish in your realm, and they have approached you, offering their services. The Turkish of the Steppe are renowned for their piety as Buddhists, which endows them with much ability in the cultural sphere, and while their acumen cannot compare with the profit-loving Sogdians, they are also capable merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.209.a;Very well, I hope they will help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.210.desc;A few Crimean Goths under your rule wish to serve you. These are curious peoples, remnants of the mighty Gothic peoples who once ruled much of Europe, spiritually loyal to the Antinomian Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.210.a;I think we'll find use for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.215.a;Welcome them! I heard they make the best noodle soup in the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.218.desc;Members of the Sinohellenic merchant community visit your court, and, impressed with your rule, wish to serve you as advisors and courtiers. ince they come from the most sophisticated, urbane, just, advanced, and cultured empire in the world, surely the advantages of having them with us are many!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.218.a;I, for one, await the day when the Chinese will take over the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.219.desc;Near your capital there is a sizeable community of merchants and others hailing from the spice islands. A few of these men have recently approached you, for they wish to offer their services.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.220.a;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.223.desc;A Tibetan monk from the Himalayas has, so it seems, made his way to our court! Some say he is a wise, compassionate spiritual master, full of good qualities, someone who would make a good advisor and mentor. Others say he is a charlatan and fraud at worst and a misguided, nonsensical "teacher" at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.223.a;I think he would make a fine addition to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.223.b;Get rid of him! He can go beg for alms elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.227.a;I am glad they have come here to live with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#silkroad.229.desc;Mongol nomads fleeing their tribal infighting have made their way to my court. They promise not to cause trouble, and to serve you to their fullest capacity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.230.desc;Scattered across the Levant are small communities of Arameans. Once an influential peoples in the region, their numbers have declined since the Muslim conquests. Today, prominent men from one of the Aramean villages of my realm have reached my court - they believe they have useful skills that I can make use of.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.230.a;Good, I am glad they want to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.231.desc;Avar tribesmen have made their way to my lands. They seek employment, believing they have better prospects with you than with their previous lords back home.;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.401.title;A Fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.401.desc;This year we shall host a great fair and market in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], an opportunity for us to encourage trade and commerce in our realm. While we can hold a standard fair, there are other fairs traditional among the Sogdian peoples as well. The Fair of Max, for instance, is where idols are sold, and merchants of different religions exchange in an atmosphere of tolerance. Conversely, at the Tirmah Fair, defective goods can be sold - in the name of good fun, of course. Then theres the Mxyrh Fair, where stolen or counterfeit things are sold - obviously the stolen goods are part of a fun tradition, rather than actual theft (usually).\n\nNow, let us send word to the Sogdian merchants and sartapaws, and to others along the Silk Road, that this year, we will have a...;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.401.a;(Normal) Sogdian Fair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.401.b;Fair of Max;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.401.c;Tirmah Fair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.401.d;Mxyrh Fair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.402.tooltip;In two months a great fair will be held!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.403.desc;Due to unforeseen circumstances, we must cancel our plans for a great market and fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] this year. While this is undoubtedly a disappointment to many, the Silk Road will continue on as it always has.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.403.a;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.404.desc;The fair at [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] is officially under way! Merchants from all over the Silk Road come to peddle their wares, trade their goods, and exchange contacts and information. Even those who arent merchants, be they commoners or nobles, can do some shopping, or enjoy some of the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.404.a;The silk must flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.405.desc;Unfortunately the Fair in at [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] has to come to an end. Merchants are leaving for elsewhere on the Silk Road. It will be a while before a fair of this magnitude will be held again, but you are happy you got a chance to participate in it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.405.a;I hope to host another one soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.406.desc;The Silk Road is like a glue that binds people of different faiths and cultures. At this fair, Im meeting Manicheans, Christians, Muslims, Nature-worshippers, Buddhists, Hindus from places as far away as Iran, China, Russia, Egypt, Greece. There are people from every corner of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.406.a;Talk with the foreigners to understand their ways and language;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.406.b;Engage in friendly religious discussion and debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.desc;During the fair, Ive encountered two men apparently in a heated argument of a religious nature. This isnt an uncommon sight here in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], even on days when business is slow. On the Silk Road, after all, there are many different religions, so its not implausible that some hot-headed people take things too far.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.a;Observe their theological debate and mud-slinging;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.b;Cheer for one side;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.c;Try to resolve the dispute - we shouldn't be arguing like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.407.d;Try to resolve the dispute - we must be tolerant during the Fair of Max!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.408.desc;Theres a reason why they call it the Silk Road, no? While Im at the fair here, why dont I take the opportunity to buy some quality silk? I could use the silk to;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.408.a;Donate to the local temple;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.408.b;Make myself some nice clothes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.408.c;Give it to my spouse as a gift;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.408.d;Give it to someone as a gift;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.409.desc;Silk isn't the only thing I can buy here at today's fair. Merchants on the Silk Road deal in a lot of different commodities. Right now I'm interested in buying...;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.409.b;Lacquerware from China;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.409.c;Incense for prayer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.409.d;A few strong horses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.410.desc;A Chinese and Sogdian man have come to you due to a dispute during the fair. The former claims that the latter sold him a slave girl claiming she was born a slave and not a free person forced into slavery, but the girl turned out to be the latter, which is illegal in China, so he can't bring her home with him. The Sogdian, though, says he never lied and told the truth from the start.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.410.a;Support the Chinese merchant in this dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.410.b;Support the Sogdian merchant in this dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.410.c;Support neither;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.410.d;This is the Tirmah Fair, remember?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_merchant_dispute_chinese;\nThe Sogdian merchant, obviously, either lied or is an idiot. Any decent merchant would be familiar with Chinese law and know that this Chinese man would not be allowed to bring the slave girl legally into China.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_merchant_dispute_sogdian;\nThe Chinese merchant should have been more careful with his purchase. Though the Sogdian merchant may have been crafty, it is the fault of the buyer for not inspecting the goods better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_merchant_dispute_neither;\nThe merchants shouldn't have come to me, do I look like a person who wants to deal with this?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_sogdian_merchant_dispute_tirmah;\nThe Chinese merchant should realize we have a Tirmah Fair this year. Shoddy goods can be sold, as long as buyers are aware of it - it's all in good fun, after all! Those arrogant Chinese should learn about others' customs first!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.desc;Slaves are often sold at these fairs. Girls from the region, known for their beauty, are popular among discerning customers from places as far as China. Today I've found a most lovely young lady - she will surely make a good consort!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.a;She will serve me, of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.b;She would make a good present for my relative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.c;She would make a good present for a courtier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.d;Hmm. Never mind, she doesnt look that great anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.411.e;If I were a man, of course. Otherwise, Im not really interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.412.desc;[FROM.GetTitledName] has bought a lovely slave girl at the great trade fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] and given her to me as a present, so that she would be my consort.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.412.a;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.413.desc;Sogdian music and dance is popular in many lands, in places as far away as China and Japan. During these fairs, both foreigners and natives, myself included, come to watch Sogdians musicians and dancers perform their art.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.413.a;Look at how that dancer moves! She's amazing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.413.b;I really like this song they're playing right now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.414.desc;A merchant has on sale a healthy Turkish slave for sale, captured and enslaved in one of the conflicts far away from [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. He seems strong and capable enough. He might prove worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.414.a;Why not? Ill buy him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.414.b;Hmm on second thought, I dont need him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.416.desc;The best part of these fairs is obviously the food! Since people come from all across the Silk Road, there are a lot of different cuisines. There's local boiled meats and vegetables, as well as flat breads, pilaf, and nutty, syrupy sweets of course, but also more exotic dishes like Chinese noodles, Indian curries, and Greek baklava. I have plenty of time to try them all, so today I'll first try some...;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.417.a;This was an important meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.418.desc;In the midst of the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], I have met with several other fellow sartapaws - some local, some from places afar - and have learned of various news concerning political stability and commercial prospects in other regions.;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.420.desc;In the midst of the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], I have met with several other important sartapaws - some local, some from places afar - to socialize and learn more about the customs and cultures of the other regions they hail from, things that I may not have known beforehand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.420.a;This gathering was fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.421.desc;Manichean priests have set themselves up along the streets of [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. They use large paintings in their sermons, to explain their religion more easily to everyone, especially illiterate peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.422.b;Ignore the monks - I don't have a good feeling about them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.423.a;Pay my respects, maybe talk a bit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.423.b;Avoid these heathen idolaters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.424.desc;Nestorians have historically formed the bulk of the Christian community along the Silk Road, on including here in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. I see a Nestorian merchant who, besides his normal wares, sells crosses and other religious objects to the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.424.a;Talk with him and his customers about their faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.424.b;Move on to another stall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.425.desc;During the fair, I come across a group of merchants praying. They are pious Muslims, it seems, who do their best to pray five times a day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.425.a;Talk with them about their faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.425.b;Go elsewhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.425.c;Join them in prayer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.426.b;Bah, theyre just selling people cheap objects of no use;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.426.c;False idols! False idols!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.427.desc;Jews make up a noticeable minority on the Silk Road, so its no surprise to see them at fairs like the one Im currently having in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. While exploring the bazaars, I came across a group of Jews arguing - something about scripture, or logic, or interpretation, something of a theological or religious nature.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.427.a;Try to understand what theyre arguing about;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.427.b;Ha ha, the silly Jews, always arguing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.427.c;I should join in their argument myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.428.desc;At the Tirmah Fair merchants are allowed to sell shoddy products. In reality, though, it is a contest between merchants won by those who can sell defective products. Some do it by manipulating and persuading potential buyers, others do it by finding creative ways to advertise their products. Buyers traditionally reward the cleverest merchants by buying their shoddy products.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.428.a;I admire the former method - it takes skill to hoodwink others;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.428.b;I find the latter method more admirable - it's great seeing all the ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.429.desc;Oh no! I bought this defective product on a whim and now I can't return it. At the Tirmah Fair, that's what's supposed to happen - people buy and sell defective products for fun - but I've realized I really don't have a use for this anywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.429.a;Damn, that merchant fooled me good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.429.b;But perhaps I can trick someone else into buying this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.430.desc;It's really fun trying to see what defective products people sell at the Tirmah Fair. It's a Sogdian tradition that's endured for centuries now. People find lots of unusual, interesting ways to use the seemingly shoddy items they buy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.430.a;This bent toothbrush here, for instance, could be a nice decoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.433.desc;At the M'xyrh Fair, people sell "stolen" products. In fact these products are simply "stolen" by friends or family as part of a game, so to speak, all in good fun. People are vigilant during the fair, trying not to get their items stolen, while at the same time waiting for opportunities to steal from others themselves. Anyone is allowed to sell or buy these "stolen" items.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.433.a;I wasn't wary enough, and my courtier stole something from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.433.b;I've managed to steal something from a courtier this year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.434.desc;A thief has been brought before me. Although people are supposedly allowed to steal and sell their stolen products at the M'xyrh Fair, this is in fact just a game friends and family play with each other. Real theft is not acceptable, but it happens from time to time, with lowly ruffians thinking they can take advantage of the atmosphere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.434.a;Punish the thief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.434.b;Be lenient on the thief - after all, this fair "celebrates" theft, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.435.desc;Curses! A real thief stole some valuables of mine during the M'xyrh Fair. Usually during the fair only family and friends are supposed to "steal" from each other, as part of the festivities. However, it's certain that a real thief was behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.435.a;This is very upsetting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.436.desc;You meet a merchant from Karghalik at the fair. His people specialize in the cultivation of a special plant the Chinese call baicao, or white grass. Its extract is poisonous, and can be used on arrow points and kills immediately. Though he doesnt sell the baicao to most of his normal customers, since you are a [Root.GetTitle], he says he can get you some for a special price.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.436.a;Sounds good! It might come in handy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.436.b;Look here, Im not interested in shady dealings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.437.desc;You encounter a noblewoman you recognize at the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName]. She has with her a lovely horse she just bought, and tells you its one of the horses from Barkol, whose people are renowned for their horse breeding. When asked where she got her new steed, she points to a horse merchant nearby, but says that the horse wont be cheap.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.437.a;Hmm. I guess I can chalk up the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.437.b;Nah, doesnt look like its worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.438.desc;A merchant from the hinterlands of the Fergana valley invites you over to his stall. The valley has been famous since ancient times for its fruits, particularly its grapes, which are made into wines, and this merchant tries to convince you to try some his produce and buy it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.438.a;Ill take a few fruits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.438.b;The wine looks good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.438.c;No thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.439.desc;You are browsing the wares of various merchants at the fair when you see a crowd up ahead. Curious, you make your way and see what all the fuss is about. It turns out to be a pair of traveling musicians, one playing a lute, the other playing a pipe. Listening carefully for a while, you recognize their style of music as being from Kucha. The city is famous for its talented musicians.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.439.a;Its great to hear something like this after so long!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.440.desc;While browsing one merchants merchandise at the fair, you come across some rather fine haircloth - that is, a stiff fabric typically made from horse or camel hair. Though hardy and practical, haircloth tends to be ugly, but this one doesnt look too bad. When the merchant tells you the cloth comes from Baluka, a kingdom renowned for its haircloth, you consider buying it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.440.a;Yes, it will do. Cant be wearing fine silks all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.440.b;No, on second thought, I dont need this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.441.desc;The size of those watermelons! So large, so round, so juicy! You hurry over to the merchant and ask him about the watermelons. He says they are from the farms around Samarkand. No surprise, then, where else could anyone find such lovely round melons? He said it was a difficult journey, hauling them over to [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] from Samarkand, but says judging by his profits so far it was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.441.a;Now let me buy some!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.441.b;As much as I want these watermelons, I have to save my money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.442.desc;You have spent much of the day at the fair, and are very thirsty, when you hear one of the vendors cry out: Get your pomegranate juice here! Fresh, authentic pomegranate juice from Khudjend! Interested, you hurry over and ask the vendor about his pomegranate juice. I make mine from a recipe my mother taught me years ago. Its a secret, though!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.442.a;Sounds good, sounds good, now Ill have some please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.442.b;Its pomegranate juice, how hard can it be? Anyways, Ill buy some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.443.desc;Walking around the fair is exhausting, so Ive decided to visit some of the food and drink vendors to see what they offer. One vendor is selling a rather strange-looking beverage. When inquired about it, he says it is a traditional Kipchak drink made from fermented honey. He learned how to make it when he traveled to the lands of the Kipchak nomads.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.443.a;I see. Ill have some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.443.b;Are you sure youre making it right? I have Kipchak blood you know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.443.c;Hmm. On second thought, never mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.444.desc;An old scholar is here in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] at the fair. He offers to sell me some old books and scrolls. Browsing through them, they appear to be written in a variation of the ancient Indian script. It could be of use, as the scholar says these hold many great wisdoms;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.444.a;Im sure some of my scholars will be able to decipher its contents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.444.b;Oh wait, I recognize the language. I think I want to study these, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.444.c;Why would I want these useless pieces of paper?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.445.desc;Ostrich eggs! Ostrich eggs! Ostrich eggs from ostriches in Arabia! Best Ostrich eggs at the [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] fair! Get your Ostrich eggs here! Ostrich eggs!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.445.a;Oooh! Ostrich eggs! I want to try some!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.445.b;I didnt come to the fair for some stupid fad of a food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.446.desc;A horse merchant is here at the fair, claiming to breed horses in the wild areas of the Fergana valley. He claims, rather boldly, that the horses of Ferghana such as those he sells are always of wonderful quality because these breeds are from the strain of a supernatural stallion, a gift from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.446.a;Im interested in that horse over there, yes, that one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.446.b;A likely tale! Ha! Ive heard better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.447.desc;At the fair Ive met a number of Sogdian merchants. One of them in seems to have made a fortune on the trade routes connecting to the city of Turfan, nicknamed Chinese Town by the Sogdians due to its large Chinese presence. He claims the brothels there are some of the best in the world, its beautiful courtesans having pleasured travelers and merchants for centuries!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.447.a;Id like to visit there someday!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.447.b;Well thats interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.447.c;Excuse me, would you mind not talking about such lewd things?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.448.desc;Talking with some of the merchants who have traveled from far-away lands to our fair has proven to be quite fascinating. Many of these men have seen so many in these travels, and sometimes I wonder if Ill ever get to see the massive Buddha statues of Bamiyan, the Cave of a Thousand Buddhas in Mogao, the Great Wall of China, or the highest peaks of the Himalayas.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.448.a;Maybe someday?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.449.desc;One merchant here at the fair is selling a wide variety of precious items from China, particularly jade.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.449.a;I want this jade amulet here;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.449.b;Jade is overrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.desc;A merchant has come here all the way from Khotan, bringing with him luxurious jade and silk manufactured in that city - the Khotanese are in fact one of the few peoples outside of China who can make these products on such a large scale. Nevertheless, due to the precious nature of these items, I better hurry before they're sold out at this fair.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.a;Some jade, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.b;I'll take that silk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.c;Why not both, jade and silk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.450.d;Ha! Second-rate imitations of the real, quality Chinese products!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.desc;There is a merchant here at the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName] who trades in precious jewels and stones. Perhaps I should buy some, and commission a local jeweler to make me something lovely? Currently, the following gems are still on sale: lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, diamonds from the heart of India, turquoise all the way from China, and amber from the cold forests of the north.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.a;Lapis Lazuli;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.b;Diamonds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.c;Turquoise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.451.d;Amber;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.452.desc;At the fair, a merchant is offering to sell me some beautifully carved ivory, made from the tusks of Indian elephants, for a rather low price.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.452.a;Sure! Ill buy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.452.b;No, not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.452.c;How cruel it is to extract this mercilessly from the elephants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.453.desc;There are some Persian rugs on sale at this fair. Im considering buying some to decorate my palace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.453.a;Should be worth it, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.453.b;Hmm on second thought, I dont need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.454.desc;MANGOES ALL THE WAY FROM MULTAN! GET YOUR MANGOES HERE! FRESH, JUICY MANGOES!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.454.a;Mmm! Sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.454.b;No thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.455.desc;One merchant at this fair has a fine selection of spices from all across the world - India, China, Africa, Persia, and elsewhere. I see pepper, saffron, cumin, tumeric, cloves, and more. I must buy some of these, so my cook can use them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.455.a;Lets see which ones would I like;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.455.b;But, then again, I dont need a lot of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.456.desc;At the fair in [VIET_sogdian_fair_location.GetName], you come across a few Zoroastrians preparing a large statue to be used in one of the upcoming events.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.456.a;Admire their work;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.456.b;Idol! False idols!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.456.c;It doesnt look that interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.457.desc;Oh, what a poor fool [FROM.GetFirstName] was! [From.GetSheHe] bought a defective product at the Tirmah Fair without realizing at first, and how [From.GetSheHe] regrets it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.457.a;What a pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
